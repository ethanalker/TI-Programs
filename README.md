# TI-Programs
Miscellaneous repository for my various TI programs. Not well organized, any larger projects that I care about will get their own repository.

CHAOS: creates sierpinski's triangle using random chaos

CHI2: calculates chi-square value from input data, uses list CHI to return critical value

COMBANAL: performs combustion analysis from input data

DECTOBI: converts a decimal number to a binary number

IRRQUAD: uses quadratric formula to return roots of a quadratic

PRODLOG: calculates the Lambert W function using newton's method

QUADROOT: finds roots of quadratic in simplest radical form, coefficients must be integers

RIEMANN: finds trapezoidal riemann sum from a table using L1 as x values and L2 as y values

SIMPRAD: finds simplest radical form of the square root of an integer

TICTAC: tic tac toe game

TODEC: converts numbers of any base to decimal

VECTOR: performs vector addition given an arbitrary number of vectors with magnitude and direction as input
